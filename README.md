# StayHunt 🏡

StayHunt is a simple Airbnb-style listings app built to understand how real backend systems work.

This project focuses on:
- Express routing  
- MongoDB + Mongoose  
- Server-side rendering with EJS  
- Full CRUD flow (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- REST-style structure  
- Method override for PATCH & DELETE  

It’s not meant to look pretty.  
It’s meant to teach me how production-style apps behavior.
